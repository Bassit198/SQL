% this table is used to calculate the maximum number of hours and associated SSN worked on a project from the works_on table. 
% will check the works_on table via E and S.
% if the value at works_on at tuple E is less than that tuple value at S, then we will keep that value and iterate tuples again to verify if any tuple is higher. 
% this is done until all tuples are compared and then the hours and essn tuples which corresponds to that highest value is stored into the tabel maxHoursSsn 

  maxHoursSsn :=
      { E.hours, E.essn | works_on(E) and  
	  not (exists S) (works_on(S) and S.hours  >  E.hours)}; 



% here is where we link the highest hour found above to the last name and first name of the employee
% this is done by iterating the tuples of the employee table and comparing the values at ssn column to that essn from the maxHoursSsn table. 
% will return the fname and lname values when the ssn and essn matches thus returning the name of the employee associated with the max hours on works_on

  q4 :=
    {E.fname, E.lname | 
    employee(E) and 
    (exists Y) 
      (maxHoursSsn(Y)  and 
       Y.essn=E.ssn)};
